						## Toxic work environments

						Note:
						- Don't think it's talked about enough
						- I wanted to cover this topic because:
							- Out of college, equipped
							- Excited
								- Boutique agency in the heart of center city
								- Learn how to code
							- At this job:
								- My failure to ask about my boss's day in the morning = public angry accusations that I was a millenial who didn't care
								- Always someone was in what we called "the doghouse"
								- Always talked poorly about coworkers behind their backs
								- Time I stood up to overtly rascist comment about a Latinx applicant = reframed in my yearly review as me "not having a sense of humor"
						- Stayed over 2 years
						- Worse, recommended friends to take my position
						- Tools to recognize a toxic environment or help someone through it
