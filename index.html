						## Toxic work environments

						Note:
						- Don't think it's talked about enough
						- I wanted to cover this topic because:

								- Boutique agency in the heart of center city
								- Learn how to code
							- Was not equipped to recognize or deal with the toxic boss and coworkers
							- Boss was:
								- Micro-managing, narcissistic
								- Created environment where he was always right
							- I thought I was cutting my teeth
							- Aren't first jobs always like this?
							- Having had good jobs since....
								- Completely unnecessary
								- I'm not a better person because of that job
						- Want to give you the tools to recognize a toxic environment or help someone through it
